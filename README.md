In these recent times (due the COVID 19), the whole system of education has been affected . With this new concept of ‘Online’ education which we are witnessing for the very first time, there’s bound to be challenges for both Students and Teachers. But now that online education has a vivid part of the system, it not’s going away anytime soon and so the solutions to the challenges of online education are of immense urgency. So, here we are presenting 'ScholarAid' for the rescue.

ScholarAid aims to provide a very different approach to online studying. It will use concepts of Artificial Intelligence , Augmented Reality , Blockchain and many more technologies to bring a new way or approach to studying . ScholarAid is going to be an android mobile application made with the aim of getting students fall in love with studies - both theoretical and practical.

## Features:

### Paraqueries (AI algorithm)

Ever opened huge ppts and pdfs right right before the exam and are clueless what and where to study from. We have got yoy sorted.
Presenting our first feature 'ParaQueries'.

It is personalised Artificial Intelligence algorithm which will 
1) Give a summary of the huge text/passage you have given 
2) Generate questions from the passage for the students to answer to test the understanding of that content by the students. 
3) Generate a report with a good visual user interface and make students understand how much well they have understood that portion.

It is a feature that will help students reduce the immense workload of going through huge contexts of text and will thereby ease their studyload by making the portion to be studied concise and easy to learn and after that the question answer feature from that context will them grasp that concept very easily. It will be a time-saver for students who tend to keep everything for the last and also a great revision tool for them and is definitely a game changer.

### Virtual World (Augmented Reality)

Ever felt online classes cannot give you a good practical experience and are only theory centered. Well we have got you covered.
Presenting our second feature 'Virtual World'.

It consists of - 3D models of Lab experiments.

Students tend to miss out the experience of laboratory experiments in online classes and main reason for missing out is ‘Lack of Visualisation’. 
So, ScholarAid will incorporate 3D models and animations to give students a LIVE feel of laboratory classes. Students will be able to do functions with the models like - open camera place it on a plane, zoom in, zoom out, rotate etc etc with the models.
(We could only make a single animated 3D model in blender of a simple Physics exp. due to time constraints and rest are imported and static)

### Flip N Focus

In this system of online education , kids from classes as low as kindergarden has to be provided with electronic devices and working parents have no way of knowing how much time their child is using phone , using our app to study or just playing around with other apps in the mobile. Well we have got you covered.

Presenting the third feature of the app - 'Flip N Focus'

Parents and the tutors of the students will get a daily report with details like :- in screen time , in app time , time when phone is not used off etc via sms. The number is being saved in the profile section of the app and when the student ends the sesssion in the phone , a sms will be received by the numbers that are saved with the details such as in screen time , in app time , time when phone is not used off etc.

### Virtual Connect
Teachers and students need a platform to connect with each other. In this feature the student can pay for a private teacher (displayed in the app) to teach him concepts via video call/one on one chat. Payment can be done through normal cash or through Smartcoins which is a blockchain based payment system in our app.

Student and teachers need to have one on one interaction daily and hence this feature of connecting people with one on one chat and video conferencing will help interact with others much better. Private tutors can earn while students can learn at the same time hence showing the buisness side of the application.

### Other pages of our app such as Login, Sign up , Profile etc

## Conclusion 

Thus by implementing all the features in our app we , Team Ctr-Alt-Elite , believe that no matter what happens in future, the education of the upcoming generation will not be compromised. We aim to provide a new approach to education in this digital world that will help develop the students in all ways possible. This type of application is not at all present in the current market and hence thereby will be a milestone in the field of Education.
